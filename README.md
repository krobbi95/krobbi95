- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @krobbi95
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum computing from almost any point - research, customer support and outreach, investor outreach (so-called "evangelizing"), etc
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to think like a computer scientist as opposed to a physicist.
- - I'm also learning how to better use python
- - I'd like to learn Java and C++ in the future
- - I have the basics of Machine learning down but want to learn more!
